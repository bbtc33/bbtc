		<h1>Rimworld Biphasic Schedule</h1>
		<h2>Stolen from Adamvseverything for personal reference because his website is extremely bloated</h2>
		<p>This Biphasic schedule is great choice for essentially everyone: Set everything to Anything.  Start at hour 11.  Set 4 blocks of Sleep: 11-12-13-14.  Jump to right before midnight: 23: sleep.  Then 0-1-2 sleep.  Then, put 2 recreation BEFORE each block of Sleep: Recreation 9-10 and 21-22.  That's the simple, fits everyone just fine don't have to think about it, Biphasic Schedule.  It is so powerful that you can even slap it on your nightowls and they will still be happier on average than a typical 'night owl schedule'.</p>
